# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A browser extension that transforms any webpage content into interactive typing practice sessions with inline typing directly on the original text. Users can select any paragraph on a webpage and practice typing by replacing the original text character-by-character with real-time feedback and statistics tracking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a typing practice enthusiast, I want to select any paragraph on a webpage for typing practice, so that I can improve my typing skills using real content that interests me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the extension button THEN the system SHALL activate selection mode and highlight all suitable paragraphs with a green outline
2. WHEN the user clicks on a highlighted paragraph THEN the system SHALL start an inline typing session on that paragraph
3. WHEN selection mode is active THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator showing the mode is enabled
4. IF a paragraph contains less than 20 characters OR contains mostly non-text content THEN the system SHALL NOT highlight it as selectable

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user practicing typing, I want real-time feedback on my typing accuracy, so that I can immediately see and correct my mistakes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types a correct character THEN the system SHALL highlight that character in green
2. WHEN the user types an incorrect character THEN the system SHALL flash the character in red and increment the error count
3. WHEN the typing session is active THEN the system SHALL wrap each character in individual spans for precise feedback
4. WHEN the user makes an error THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback without blocking continued typing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a typing student, I want to see my typing statistics in real-time, so that I can monitor my progress and performance during practice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a typing session starts THEN the system SHALL display a floating stats popup showing WPM, accuracy, and progress
2. WHEN the user types each character THEN the system SHALL update the statistics in real-time
3. WHEN calculating WPM THEN the system SHALL use the formula (completed characters / 5) / (time elapsed in minutes)
4. WHEN calculating accuracy THEN the system SHALL use the formula ((completed characters - errors) / completed characters) * 100

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a regular user, I want my personal typing records tracked and saved, so that I can see my improvement over time and celebrate achievements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a typing session completes THEN the system SHALL check if new personal records were achieved
2. WHEN a new record is set THEN the system SHALL display a celebration message highlighting the achievement
3. WHEN the extension is used THEN the system SHALL persist personal records including best WPM, best accuracy, total sessions, and average WPM
4. WHEN the browser is restarted THEN the system SHALL retain all previously saved personal records

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control my typing session easily, so that I can exit when needed and see my final results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses the Escape key during typing THEN the system SHALL end the session and display a summary
2. WHEN the user completes typing the entire paragraph THEN the system SHALL automatically display the session summary
3. WHEN a typing session ends THEN the system SHALL restore the original paragraph content exactly as it was
4. WHEN the session summary is shown THEN the system SHALL display final WPM, accuracy, error count, and any new records achieved

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a browser extension user, I want the typing practice to work seamlessly across different websites, so that I can practice on any content without compatibility issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is installed THEN the system SHALL use Manifest V3 for modern browser compatibility
2. WHEN the extension modifies webpage content THEN the system SHALL preserve original formatting and layout
3. WHEN the extension processes text THEN the system SHALL use non-destructive text replacement that can be fully restored
4. WHEN the extension operates THEN the system SHALL have minimal impact on webpage performance and loading times

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the extension to be fully accessible, so that I can use it regardless of my abilities or assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard-only navigation THEN the system SHALL support all functionality without requiring mouse interaction
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide compatible markup and appropriate ARIA labels
3. WHEN high contrast mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL maintain clear visual feedback and readability
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without breaking the user experience
